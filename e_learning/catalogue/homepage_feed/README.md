### Prologue

Interactive and vibrant homepages are a norm on most ecommerce. By vibrant we mean lots of icons and graphics of products and categories neatly (sometimes not so much !) stacked on the home screen. Almost like a supermarket facade or shelf. We want to build that and keep updating it dynamically from the backend without having to deploy our code again and again. 

We are trying to create something that looks like this 👇🏻

The same principle for building the above dynamic screen can be extended elsewhere.

This a working example of backend driven UI with personalized elements plugged into it.

### What does it do ?

Lorem ipsum. 

- 🦅 **Early bird deals**
- ⚡️ **Flash sales**
- ⏰ **Latecomer deal**
- 💫 **Special pricing on all art courses - no coupon needed !!**
- "add your request here ?"


We can assume a scale of 1million registered users on the platform and 1000 courses (unique SKUs) on offer by 300 teachers. Some of our teachers constantly offer early bird deals and run flash sales. Additionally, we offer discounts on certain categories and courses from time to time.
