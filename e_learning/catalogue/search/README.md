### What does it do ?

"X" is a platform for teachers to setup and sell their short online courses. 🛜 👩‍🏫

- A course has a fixed start and end date and runs as per the schedule. 
- It has a title and a description for the students to understand the curriculum better.
- A course is taught by a single teacher and has a price that the students have to pay for before registering.
- The courses can be searched by students

[TODO] Roadmap :
