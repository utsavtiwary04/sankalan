Collection of ready-to-use code modules (with explanation) which solve commonly occurring business use cases.

Too often we have a kickass product idea in our head but building out the MVP and the first few version saps out the enrgy and enthusiasm to continue. Not anymore!


#### üë• **Intended Audience**
------------
Early-stage entrepreneurs, software engineers (and freshers), indie-hackers, builders or programming enthusiasts who are looking for more than just a boilerplate and want some level of customization to their website without the frills and fat.

*Example: You are trying to build a rewards system for your e-commerce website but either find it too intimidating to tackle all the use cases that you foresee OR get stuck in an endless loop of building "just enough" to keep it flexible for the future.*

#### üì¶ **Each module contains ..**
------------
fully functional code with explanation. 

Think database models, application code, in-line comments and a graphical explanation to go with it. Written in Python it can be used in a plug-and-play manner with a few tweaks so that your time spent on the starting point is minimized and you can get your system running.

The level of complexity is kept at a bare minimum to make sure your product "works" and is "flexible" enough to accommodate growing complexities in the mid to long term.

Additionally, we have tried to leverage best practices around logging, error handling, design patterns and clean code to ensure maintainability and extensibility for the future.
