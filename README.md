Collection of ready-to-use modules (with explanation) for addressing commonly occurring business use cases. See README for more.


### üö® Why is it needed ?

- Go from "idea" to a "functional product" faster
- Collaborate and solve complex problems better
- Share and learn with the wider community ‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è



</br>
### üë• **Intended Audience**
------------
Early stage entrepreneurs, indie-hackers, builders or programming enthusiasts who are looking for more than just a boilerplate and want some level of customization in their product without the frills and fat.

*Example: You are trying to build a rewards system for your e-commerce website but either find it too intimidating to tackle all the use cases that you foresee OR get stuck in an endless loop of building "just enough" to keep it flexible for the future.*

</br>
### üì¶ **Each module contains ..**
------------
- Explanation of the business problem being solved, 
- database models,
- working application code,
- and graphical explanations.

Written in Python, the code can be used in a plug-and-play manner with a few tweaks so that your time spent on the starting point is minimized and you can get your system up & running quickly.

The level of complexity is kept at a bare minimum to make sure your code "just works" and is "flexible" enough to accommodate growing complexities in the mid to long term.
