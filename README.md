#### üö® Why is it needed ?

- Go from "idea" to a "functional product" faster
- Collaborate and solve complex problems better
- Share and learn with the wider community ‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è

Each problem statement is described and solved with fully functional code and explanations.

</br>
#### üë• **Intended Audience**
Early stage entrepreneurs, indie-hackers, builders or programming enthusiasts who are looking for more than just a boilerplate and want some level of customization in their product without the frills and fat.

*üìí **Example**: You are trying to build a rewards system for your e-commerce website but either find it too intimidating to tackle all the use cases that you foresee OR getting stuck in an endless loop of building "just a bit more" to keep it flexible for the future.*

</br>
#### üì¶ **Each module contains ..**
- Explanation of the business problem being solved, 
- database models,
- working application code,
- and graphical explanations.

Written in Python, the code can be used in a plug-and-play manner with a few tweaks so that your time spent on the starting point is minimized and you can get your system up & running quickly.

The level of complexity is kept at a bare minimum to make sure your code "just works" and is "flexible" enough to accommodate growing complexities in the mid to long term.
