##  ðŸ“© ðŸ“ž Customer Engagement Engine 

 .. the system behind those quirky notifications, annoying emails and pesky WhatsApp notifications (sometimes useful). 
 
 When built and used correctly, a user engagement platform can drive significant uptick in revenue and conversions for your product - users relate to your brand, possibly like it and make a purchase. And when done wrong - [you might end up drawing the government's scrutiny](https://www.google.com/search?q=pesky+bajaj+finance&sca_esv=573076625&tbm=nws&sxsrf=AM9HkKmXVnJ-7nAkmLa-IQjld_FAoUoOfw:1697173238748&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwig6pGAn_KBAxUWUGwGHSbfCpgQ_AUoAXoECAIQAw&biw=1280&bih=595&dpr=2)
 
#### Why is it needed after all ? 

The user of your product is not going to spend his or her entire time on app. The competition for attention is stiff - and being present across channels "responsibly" can help your product stay a couple of steps ahead of competing products. (social media, news, email inbox)

Broadly the purpose of engaging users could be 
- **promotional**  *"Upto 50% off on selected items for the next 2 hours"*
- **informational** *"Top 3 stories from the world of AI this week"*
- **transactional** - *Your cc ending 0001 has been charged $4.99 on your recent purchase ref: CE-09564TX*

#### Product Requirements

Essentially the goal of the system is to let your company (especially the marketing and revenue teams) do the following

A. **"Segment"** users basis their behaviour and activity on the platform
B. **"Create a content library"** to pick and choose the media to be sent out to users
C. **"Setup engagement campaigns"** depending on the user segment and the desired "goal"
D. Trigger the campaign and "**observe the metrics**"

<u>Segment</u> : Users that display similar behaviour basis their activity or intrinsic characteristics 
Ex -* "Customers who have logged in every day since signup for 10 days straight"* or *"Customers who ended up buying a second time within a week after their first purchase"*

<u>Content Library </u> : All your media - images, textual content, videos, GIFs that you plan on sending out.

<u>Campaign</u> : Set of rules according to which you want to target your users with a set of content.

<u>Metrics</u> : You gotta measure what you tried to achieve via your campaign!
Each message sent out costs you money and more importantly your user's attention potentially. "Click through rates", "impressions" and "conversions" are commonly used metrics for such campaigns. Conversion can mean different things in different context and hence is subjective - could be a purchase, could be a new blog post or a visit to a landing page.
